# Assesment 1 Quality Attributes

__(a). Have a look at chapters 16 and 17 from MS Application Architecture Guide. What is the difference between quality attributes and crosscutting concerns?__

They both affect the entire application. The difference between them is that quality attributes affect the behavior, design and user experience of the system. So they affect decisions that will be made. The crosscutting concerns are more about actions that are performed throughout the application and therefore should be placed on a central place.

__(b). What is the difference between a Perspective and a Viewpoint as defined in Software Systems Architecture?__

A viewpoint is about the concerns of the stakeholders for a certain view. It is more about explaining the system in an understandable way for that certain group of stakeholders. A perspective helps to achieve certain quality properties.
