# Assesment 2 - Architectural Patterns

__(a). Describe in your own words what the difference is between design patterns as taught in the previous period (the Gang-of-Four patterns) and architectural patterns.__

__(b). Design patterns and architectural patterns are often based on the same ideas. Which design patterns are most similar to the architectural patterns Pipes and Filters and Indirection? (Pipes and filters is described on page 140-142 of Software Systems Architecture).__

__(c). Give an example of the application of the Pipes and Filters-pattern.__

__(d). Lookup an architectural pattern of your choice and describe it in your own words. You are not
allowed to copy/paste any text from existing sources. Use the same format as the example description of the Shared Repository-pattern given on Blackboard. Also, have a look at the article A Pattern Language for Pattern Writing (especially patterns B.1 and B.2) for an explanation of the pattern elements in the template.__
