What are the relevant viewpoints and perspectives?


What are the architecturally significant functional and non-functional requirements?


What are the major tradeoffs you have to make when trying to satisfy competing requirements for this system? Document your critical Design Decisions with alternatives and rationale. Consider technology choices for several areas. Research which options you have and again present a substantiated choice in the form of a design decision.


Which ‘perspectives’ are the most relevant for the system?


Which tactics do you use from the perspectives and why?


How can you be confident that you will meet the significant requirements? Is it a matter of convincing argumentation? Or do you need to test some stuff?
