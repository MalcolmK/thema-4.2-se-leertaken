# Assignment 3

**(a) What are the main quality attributes the stakeholders are interested in? Give three quality attributes for each stakeholder.**

__Development/Maintenance team:__

1. Maintainability
2. Modifiability
3. Testability

__Management:__

1. Configurability
2. Customizability
3. Affordability

**(b) Give two other possible stakeholders we could have considered for this system. What would their concerns be?**

1. End-users
2. Administrators

**(c) Study the system (source code and available documentation). Write a SAD based on the template at www.rupopmaat.nl. Make sure to include UML component diagram(s), package diagram(s) and deployment diagram(s).**

See attached `SAD Project DolVA.pdf`.

**(d) Identify three important design decisions that have been taken for the system. Where these design decisions documented by the original developers? What were the alternatives? What decision would you have made, with what rationale?**

1. __Design decision:__ *API Based*

	__Documented by original developers:__ Yes, it is documented. The given rationale is: *"Because of the simplicity of addressing there was made the decision to use a RESTful API. This reduces the complexity as much as possible."*

	__The alternatives:__ The alternative would have been to let every end point communicate directly with the application layer.

	__Our decision and rationale:__ We would have made the same decision, because there is less tight coupling between the UI of the CMS and the logical view of the CMS. This makes it less far-reaching if you want to change the language used for the UI.

2. __Design decision:__ *Cordova App*

	__Documented by original developers:__ Yes, it is documented. The given rationale is: *"Cordova makes it possible to develop without using the device's native APIs."*

	__The alternatives:__ The alternative would have been to build native apps in Java and Swift.

	__Our decision and rationale:__ We would have made the same decision, because by using Cordova you combine best of both the browser possibilities and built-in native functionalities. And you can make one app which can be used cross platform.

3. __Design decision:__ *MySQL*

	__Documented by original developers:__ Yes, it is documented. The given rationale is: *"Because there is a strong relational character between the data and there is a relatively small set of subjects."*

	__The alternatives:__ Yes, there were a lot of alternatives, e.g. Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and a lot of others.

	__Our decision and rationale:__ We would have made the same decision, because of the wide use of MySQL and the strong relation between the different data.

**(e) How could the architecture of the system be improved? Give suggestions for improvement, at least one for every view.**

1. __Improvements to the logical view__ 

	__Suggestion(s):__

2. __Improvements to the development view__ 

	__Suggestion(s):__ 

3. __Improvements to the process view__ 

	__Suggestion(s):__ 

4. __Improvements to the physical view__ 

	__Suggestion(s):__ 

5. __Improvements to the scenarios / use case view__ 

	__Suggestion(s):__ There could be made Use Case Diagrams and Use Case Descriptions. At this moment there are only User Stories. Although they are quite extensive, it is useful to have an overview in both a Use Case Diagram and Use Case Description.

**(f) The standard views are probably too technical for Martin. Write a management view. You are allowed to make reasonable assumptions. (This exercise is about writing for a non-technical person and being able to imagine the things heâ€™s interested in.)**

See attached `Management Review.pdf`.
