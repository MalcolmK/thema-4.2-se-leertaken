# Assignment 1B

**The main difference between the definition of architecture as given by Rozanski & Woods and the definition of IEEE is the clause “the principles guiding its design and evolution”.**

**Why do you think the IEEE included this in the definition?**

Because by including this in the definition, you are forcing the use of a certain view on the system and on the future. By doing this, everyone will not only have the same goal, but they are also trying to achieve this in the same way.

**Give an example of a system and two principles “guiding its design and evolution”.**
