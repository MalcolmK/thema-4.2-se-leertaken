# Assignment 1B

**The main difference between the definition of architecture as given by Rozanski & Woods and the definition of IEEE is the clause “the principles guiding its design and evolution”.**

**Why do you think the IEEE included this in the definition?**

Because by including this in the definition, you are forcing the use of a certain view on the system and on the future. By doing this, everyone will not only have the same goal, but they are also trying to achieve this in the same way.

**Give an example of a system and two principles “guiding its design and evolution”.**

One of the principles of the definition of Rozanski & Woods is: *"It is not possible to capture the functional features and quality properties of a complex system in a single comprehensible model that is understandable by and of value to all stakeholders."* You can see this in the many viewpoints they have defined.
