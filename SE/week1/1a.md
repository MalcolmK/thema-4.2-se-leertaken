**Describe in a few lines what the most important differences and similariTes are between RUP, XP and the waterfall-approach.**

Opposite to XP and the Waterfall-approach, RUP focuses on well prescribed documents (roles, artifacts, activities). This helps to prevent problems in the further process of the project. XP and the Waterfall-approach focus more on reacting to problems/change rather than preventing it.

In RUP the cost of change is high, whereas in the Waterfall-approach it is less, and in XP (Agile) it is low.

RUP is model driven and requires more experienced developers than in Agile methods.
