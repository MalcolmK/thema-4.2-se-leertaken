# Assignment 1a

**Describe in a few lines what the most important differences and similarities are between RUP, XP and the waterfall-approach.**

Opposite to XP and the Waterfall-approach, RUP focuses on well described documents (roles, artifacts, activities) that are written up front. This helps to prevent problems in the further process of the project. XP focus more on reacting to problems/change rather than preventing it. Waterfall has no proper reaction to changes and expects there are no disturbances.

In the Waterfall-approach the cost of change is high, whereas in the RUP it is less, and in XP it is low.
