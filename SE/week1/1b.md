# Assignment 1b

**Create your own compact software process aimed at a student project with a size of about 3 weeks and 4 students. Describe:**

- The roles which your process contains;
- The disciplines which your process contains (if you decide to leave certain disciplines out then explain
why);
- The artifacts that each discipline should produce. Again give your argumentation (‘rationale’). Why do you choose these artifacts?

## Roles

- **Stakeholders**
	- Product Owner
	- Steering Group
- **Business modelling**
	- Team Leader
	- Development Team
- **Requirements**
	- Information Analist
	- Use Case Designer
- **Analysis and design**
	- Software Architect
	- User Interface Designer
- **Implementation**
	- Developer
- **Test**
	- Test Manager
	- Tester
- **Deployment**
	- Tool Manager
	- Integrator

## Disciplines

### Business modelling

- List of Risks
- List of Bottlenecks
- Iteration Plan (Task Board)
- Iteration Burndown Chart

We chose 'List of Risks' because every project does have certain risks. On of the most common risks e.g. is the deadline. It is wise to describe those risks in a document. This way, everybody knows what the risks are and how likely it is they will happen.

We chose 'List of Bottlenecks' because most projects does have certain aspects which could hold up the whole project. If you make a list of those up front, it will be easier to anticipate to these. It maybe will be possible to avoid those bottlenecks.

We chose 'Iteration Plan (Task Board)' because doing this will make it for every anticipator clear what will be done during this iteration. Questions like "What do I have to do now?" will be more unlikely to occur.

We chose 'Iteration Burndown Chart' because the progress of the project will be insightful more easy.

NOT:
We did not chose for 'Software Development Plan' because it is a bit of an overkill to create such a document for a small project like ours. Dependencies of each other can be discussed without slowing down the project. Because this is a smaller project you can easily anticipate on dependencies.

We did not chose for 'Progress Report' because the documenten would likely be the same every time. There might would be some slight differences between them, but not noteworthy.
