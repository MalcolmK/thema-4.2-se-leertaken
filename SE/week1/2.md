# Assignment 2

**Which artifacts does RUP define concerning testing?**

RUP defines the following artifacts:

- Test Plan
- Test Design
- Test Suite
- Test Report

**Describe what each does in a few sentences and what the relationships are between them.**

The **Test Plan** artifact is a document that describes how and in what environment the testing is done. It defines the test scope, which indicates in how much detail the tests must be written. This level of detail can be measured by code coverage percentage. It describes the type of tests and which tooling is used. Also it gives more information on how the tests are organized and how the test environment is set up.

The **Test Design**  artifact is a document describing what elements are tested (for example which Use Case scenarios and non-functional requirements) and what test cases will be used for it. The test design can also include test scripts and test data.

The **Test Suite** artifact is a summary of the tools that are used for testing. These can include:

- Automated tests (for example unit-tests or continuous integration platforms);
- The testing environment (framework);
- Test data and test scripts to install, configure, or prepare the tools;
- Tools used for manual testing.

Maintaining and improving the test suite is a shared responsibility for the developers and the testers.

The **Test Report** artifact is a document that describes test activities, test results, and test summaries per iteration.

**At which point in time are the artifacts produced?**

As a best practice to verify the software quality testing should be a major part of the project at any point of time. Testing becomes heavier as the project progresses but should be a constant factor in any software product creation.

This means that the **Test Plan** is writtin at the start of the project. To lay a clear foundation for the testing enviroment. The other artifacts (**Test Design, Test Suite, and Test Report**) continue to evolve over time. Especially the **Test Report** can be useful to determine certain bottlenecks in the project. It is therefore wise to produce this report after each iteration.

As seen in the RUP hump chart above, testing is done throughout the entire project. Yet it does not have to consume a big chunk of the de project's time (comparing the implementation and testing disciplines in the figure above).
